# Spread-of-covid-19-in-KSA

## Introduction
COVID-19 is “a newly discovered coronavirus that infects humans and whose [rapid] spread has [led] to a global pandemic with zero available therapeutic strategies” (Mamoor, 2020, p. 5).

## Problem Statement
To explore how the outbreak of COVID-19 has spread around the world in such a short time and try to predict how it will continue to spread in order to provide insights to help combat the disease.

## Methodology
Model the data using time series.

## Data Understanding
In this section, a complete overview of the data is provided, such as the number of variables, missing percentages, data size, and column types.

### Dataset Description
The 'covid_19_clean_complete' file contains the cumulative count of confirmed, death and recovered cases of COVID-19 from different countries from 22nd January 2020.

### Description of Columns:
Province/State: contains the provinces and states that are affected by the virus.
Country/Region: contains the countries and regions that are affected by the virus.
Lat: contains the latitude of the location.
Long: contains the longitude of the location.
Date: contains the date of cumulative report.
Confirmed: contains cumulative number of confirmed cases till this day.
Deaths: contains cumulative number of deaths till this day.
Recovered: contains cumulative number of recovered cases till this day.


## Observations
From the data:

At an early stage, COVID-19 seemed to be only in China and its neighboring countries.
Then it quickly spread to Europe, US, and other countries.
In West Asia, especially Iran and Iraq, the virus spread quickly at the end of February, while the virus was spreading rapidly in Italy.
Around March 5, the virus started spreading in Europe. On March 9, Italy imposed a national quarantine.
According to the data so far, the US, UK, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France are still in the midst of a major outbreak.
In Saudi Arabia, the virus started spreading on March 5. A far-reaching lockdown and airport closures slowed down the virus but did not stop it from spreading.
Conclusion
Based on outside research, but proven by the data, the spread of COVID-19 declined when countries implemented restrictive quarantines and lockdowns inhibiting the movement of their citizens.
